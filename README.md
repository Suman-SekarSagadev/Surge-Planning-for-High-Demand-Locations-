# Surge Planning for High-Demand Locations  

## 📌 Objective  
To reduce order cancellations and customer churn in high-demand areas by implementing a surge incentive strategy to attract more drivers during peak hours.  

## ⚡ Challenges  
- Supply was consistently lower than demand in high-demand zones.  
- High order cancellations due to driver unavailability.  
- Customer churn increased because of repeated service unavailability.  
- No effective incentive mechanism to encourage drivers during peak hours.  

## 🛠️ Actions  
- Analyzed large booking datasets to identify zones where demand significantly exceeded supply.  
- Conducted churn and cancellation analysis to measure the impact of low driver availability.  
- Designed a **surge incentive model** (₹30–₹40 per order extra during peak hours).  
- Coordinated with product & operations teams to communicate surge incentives via in-app notifications and WhatsApp groups.  
- Continuously monitored fulfillment rates and driver participation post-implementation.  

## ✅ Outcomes  
- Driver participation increased significantly in high-demand areas.  
- **Order fulfillment improved from 53% to 78% within 2 weeks.**  
- Customer cancellations reduced noticeably, leading to lower churn.
